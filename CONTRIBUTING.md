##Label Groups

We group labels by colour, according to broad themes.

##Problems

Issues that make the product feel broken. High priority, especially if its present in production. colour: #B60205 following labels are available: bug,security

##Mindless

Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks. colour:#A89D30 following labels are available: chore

##Experience

##Environment

Server environment. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments. colour:#BB1F9C

##Feedback

Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here. colour:#11DF93

##Improvements

Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Owner” field to an existing “Calendar” model in the API, for example. colour:#2F0F85

##Additions

Brand new functionality. New pages, workflows, endpoints, etc. colour:#F88212

##Pending

Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data. colour:#72E3CD

##Inactive

No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope. colour:#72E3CD
